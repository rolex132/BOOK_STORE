Welcome to **Vetri-Nichyam**, an evolving full-stack ecosystem where I (ANANTH) experiment, learn, break, rebuild, and master real-world development.  
This repository is not just a project folder…  
It is a **journey**, a **timeline**, and a **production-grade technical playground**.

# 🎯 What Is This Repository?
**Vetri-Nichyam** is a full-stack learning megaproject containing multiple mini-applications such as:

- UI component explorations  
- React mini-apps  
- Express backend setups  
- Login systems  
- MVC-style practice modules  
- API structure experiments  
- Code architecture trials  

Everything here is handcrafted manually — no auto-gen.  
Every folder is a reflection of how I leveled up as a developer.

📁 Repo:
Let me store everything — organized, scalable, future-proof.

✨ Vetri-Nichyam:
Welcome, creator. Success is certain. Start building.
